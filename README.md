An Endless Swimmer in Phaser3
Made for CMPM120 at UCSC

Using the JavaScript framework Phaser3 I put a unique twist on the classic endless runner genre. With the main character being a stingray, a "Sea Pancake", I went with the ocean/sea-life theme and added shark enemies which periodically target the player as they're swimming and collecting stacks of pancakes.

This project features custom sprites and animations created by me. This endless runner gives a relaxing player feel at first, but quickly turns into a fast paced and suspenseful dodge and weave game. 

Apart from custom artwork this project features scene management, player input, high score tracking, animations, menus, update loops, classes, configs, collisions, and physics.

Challenges: Creating animations in Phaser3. Drawing frames using the sprites I created. Designing the sharks to feel "random" in terms on their spawn location when they respawn on the right side of the screen. How to balance the gameplay to increase in difficulty as gameplay progresses as typical endless runners tend to do. 

Learned: Animations in Phaser3, physics and collisions in Phaser. 2D pixel art sprites. Time management when creating a solo project from start to finish with multiple menus, UI elements. How to create a bit of resistance in the water to make the movement feel a bit more like swimming.
